## Concept Proposal
We want you to take some of the feedback you received from the brainstorming session to flesh out your project and give a more formal proposal. We understand that at this point, some of what you write will be guesses, so this is a <strong>living document</strong> that may change over time. Create a file called <code>concept.md</code> in your repository and include details in the following sections:

<code>concept.md</code>
  - Project Name
  - Goals
  - Context
  - Novelty
  - Functionality
  - Audience
  - Challenges
  - Measures
  - Motivation
  - Future Extensions
  - *Other (Optional)*

**Goals:** The primary benefits and goals of the proposed project and how this project is intended to address the need/opportunity just described.

The primary benefit I see for this project is having it be an introductory project for my interest in data analysis. It's a field that I haven't had much exposure to but I do believe that working on this will peak my interest and then give me a little bit of an idea of what working on a future project containing data will look like. 

The goal for this project is to be able to create a machine learning algorithm that will allow us to make object counting image easier. An image will be presented to the model and then provide an estimation of the objects inside. I want to eventually be able to implement my model with the object counting function to make our estimations as accurate as they can be. 

**Context:** A statement context for the proposed project including a statement of the need or opportunity which your project is intended to address. Including very brief descriptions of existing similar products and their utility and limitations and/or advantages and disadvantages. (Use hyperlinks

The context for the project involves 

**Novelty:** The novelty of your solution and/or the enhancements you propose

The machine learning approach has already been introduced with qualification of the astronomical objects, specifically galaxies. So qualification is not as much as a novel idea in this situation. 

**Functionality:** The expected project functionality and characteristics

For functionality, the program will allow the user to insert a low resolution image and the able to put it through our learning model to then categorize the number of objects that are inside that image. 

**Audience:** Describe the intended audience of users and the main usability goals (i.e. how the expected users will benefit from your proposed project)

The intended audience will be curious individuals who are curious when they see an image of space, and then wonder what the number of images are going to be. It would be people who would be curious about the project that I worked on over the summer. 

**Challenges:** The challenges that you anticipate encountering during this projectâ€™s development

The biggest challenge in my opinion will be the process of having to learn everything there has to be about machine learning since it will be the first time that I will be attempting a project on it as well as everything there has to be about learning what it is. 

**Measures:** An outline of project measures of success (how you will know when you have met the requirements.)

Measurements will be made by testing the functionality of the machine learning algorithm.

**Motivation:** Briefly describe your primary personal motivation for this choice of project. i.e. why is this important to you, why you have selected it, and how you hope/expect it will enhance your career.

Machine learning has been a topic that I've been interested in for a long time. Is found almost all personal electronic personal items that include smart technology. I've always been a nerd that is interested in the idea of upcoming and smart tech, so I think that the more I work on projects that include machine learning and ai, then I will get the necessary practice that will be required to go into this field. 

Data analysis is something I would also like to work with. Machine learning is a good example on how data is handled as well as manipulated. Working with numbers and developing different ways that you can work with it is extremely fun, interesting, and challenging. 

**Future Extensions:** Possible extensions to the proposed project to be completed only if time permits

If time permits then I would like to extend my program to work intricately with the 2023 URCPP cohorts object counting algorithm. 

**Other:** (Optional section) To the above, you may add any additional items that you think will strengthen your proposal.
