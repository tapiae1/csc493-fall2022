The objective of this test plan is to ensure that the Image Generation and Prediction System functions correctly and efficiently. The system generates random images, creates a CSV file with image data, builds a predictive model using linear regression, and evaluates the model's performance. This test plan outlines the approach, scope, and activities to verify the system's functionality.

## Key Test Cases
Test Case 1: TC001 - Directory Creation

    Requirement: The script should create a directory named 'generated_images' if it doesn't already exist.
    Preconditions: None.
    Steps:
        Run the make_image_dir function.
        Check if the directory 'generated_images' exists.
    Desired Results: The directory 'generated_images' should be created if it doesn't exist.

Test Case 2: TC002 - Input Prompt Handling

    Requirement: The script should correctly handle user inputs for the number of images and the size of images.
    Preconditions: None.
    Steps:
        Run the ask_for_images function.
        Input valid numbers for both prompts.
    Desired Results: The function should return the correct integer values for the number of images and the size of images.

Test Case 3: TC003 - Image Generation

    Requirement: The script should generate a specified number of images with the given size.
    Preconditions: Directory 'generated_images' should exist.
    Steps:
        Run the generate_multiple_images function with specified num_images and size_images.
        Verify the number and size of generated images.
    Desired Results: The correct number of images of the specified size should be generated.

Test Case 4: TC004 - CSV File Creation

    Requirement: The script should create a CSV file with the correct header and data rows.
    Preconditions: Images should be generated, and the number of ones should be calculated.
    Steps:
        Run the write_csv function with the generated images and their respective counts of ones.
        Check the content of the created CSV file.
    Desired Results: The CSV file should have the correct header and the correct number of rows with accurate data.

Test Case 5: TC005 - Data Preparation

    Requirement: The script should correctly prepare the data for the linear regression model.
    Preconditions: The CSV file 'generated_csv.csv' should exist.
    Steps:
        Run the prepare_data function.
        Verify the returned x and y data frames.
    Desired Results: The x and y data frames should be correctly prepared from the CSV file.

Test Case 6: TC006 - Model Building

    Requirement: The script should build a linear regression model using the training data.
    Preconditions: Data should be split into training and testing sets.
    Steps:
        Run the build_model function with X_train and Y_train.
        Check if the linear regression model is created and trained.
    Desired Results: The linear regression model should be successfully built and trained with the training data.

Test Case 7: TC007 - Prediction and Evaluation

    Requirement: The script should make predictions using the testing set and evaluate the model performance.
    Preconditions: The linear regression model should be built.
    Steps:
        Run the make_testing_prediction function with the model and X_test.
        Run the evaluate_performance function with Y_test and the predictions.
    Desired Results: Predictions should be made successfully, and the evaluation should return an accurate R2 score and visualize the performance.
