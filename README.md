# *Machine Learning to Estimate Objects in Astronomical Photographs*
# Project Concept
[Project Concept] (codebase/concept.md)

## Scope

The objective of this project is to create a machine learning project that will take multiple astronomical images, whether it be synthetic or not, as a testing set, and then create a machine learning model that will be fed these images as a way to train it for future inputs. These future inputs are going to be testing images that are similar to the ones that the model was trained with to then be able to figure out the number of objects that are inside of them. There will be multiple prompts to the user that will ask how many testing images they are going to want and the sizes of the testing images. There will also be optional visualizations of the data and performance of the models that the user can choose to see. Any images that are not astronomical images, as well as images with a full color spectrum would be out of scope for the project. 

## Vision 

The vision for this future would be tied closely tied to the 2024 URCPP research done with professor Deanna Wilborne. The purpose of the project would be to help in the research goal of estimating the number of objects that are found in astronomical images. In theory, the machine learning algorithm would be working in tandem with the 2023 object detector that was made by the previous 2023 URCPP research group. The intent for the project was to be a way to good effort in getting the estimations that we are trying to achieve. The machine learning algorithm could be used as a way to verify the estimations that are made from my colleagues. 

## Description/Motivation

Your formally written project proposal description, and why it is useful/interesting/fun goes here. Try to be as descriptive as possible, as we will be discussing your project ideas during the brainstorming in class.

As a participant in the 2024 URCPP with professor Deanna Wilborne, I wanted to help tackle the goal of achieving accurate estimations of objects in astronomical photographs. I had the chance to possibly earn the ALE and Capstone course credit upon a successful project outcome at the end of my URCPP research. 

When trying to select a good worthy enough project to be able to work on during the summer, I had to pick a project that needed to be directly involved with the research that I was doing. A simple GUI implementation would've be a good enough project to use, so I needed a challenge be able to gain knowledge and experience during its creation. I wanted to work on something that I knew I could learn a lot from and still be useful years down the road. 

So I decided to work on a project that would use machine learning and some other python data analysis libraries to help me with starting to handle and manipulate different kinds of data. 

I want my program to be a machine learning program that would take synthetic images of astronomical photographs and then use a learning model, like from the scikitlearn library to be able to use a learning model, like linear regression, or a classification model of some sort to be able to estimate the number of objects that are in future image inputs.
